I will perform the following steps to migrate and start the project:

1.  **Update `README.md`**:
    *   Replace all occurrences of `d:/myCode/formal-projects/ad-fontes-prompts/` with `d:/myCode/formal-projects/ad-fontes-manager/`.
    *   Update relative paths from `tool/yaml2pg/web` to `web` to reflect the current project structure.
2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    *   Install backend dependencies in `web/` using `npm install`.
    *   Install frontend dependencies in `web/client/` using `npm install`.
3.  **Start the Project**:
    *   Start the development server using `npm run dev` in the `web/` directory.

This will ensure the documentation is accurate and the project is running correctly in its new location.
